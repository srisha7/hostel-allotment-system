There are more than two billion Internet users worldwide—that’s approximately 30% of
the Earth’s population.1 In use today are more than a billion general-purpose computers,
and billions more embedded computers are used in cell phones, smartphones, tablet computers, home appliances, automobiles and more—and many of these devices are connected to the Internet. According to a study by Cisco Internet Business Solutions Group, there
were 12.5 billion Internet-enabled devices in 2010, and the number is predicted to reach
25 billion by 2015 and 50 billion by 2020..</div><br><br>
<div id="p2">These are exciting times in the computer field. Many of the most influential and successful
businesses of the last two decades are technology companies, including Apple, IBM, Hewlett Packard, Dell, Intel, Motorola, Cisco, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Groupon, Foursquare, Yahoo!, eBay and many more. These companies are major
employers of people who study computer science, information systems or related disciplines.

computers throughout the world.</div>
